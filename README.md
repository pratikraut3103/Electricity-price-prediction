# Electricity-price-prediction
In this endeavor, I embarked on a captivating journey delving into the intricate world of electricity price prediction. Leveraging advanced time series forecasting techniques, I engineered a predictive model that holds the potential to unravel the mystique of impending electricity prices with remarkable accuracy.

Key Highlights:

1. Methodology and Model Selection:
With meticulous scrutiny of available methodologies, I embraced the Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model as the cornerstone of my predictive framework. Recognized for its efficacy in capturing both seasonality and autocorrelation, the SARIMA model emerged as the ideal candidate to handle the complexities of electricity price dynamics.

2. Predicting the Next Two Days:
My project's pivotal goal was to provide insights into future electricity prices, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions. I adeptly tailored the SARIMA model to predict electricity prices for the forthcoming two days, offering a tangible glimpse into the immediate future of energy markets.

3. Unveiling Seasonal Decomposition:
At the crux of my methodology lay the art of seasonal decomposition. By dissecting the time series data into its constituent components of seasonality, trend, and noise, I harnessed the power to fathom the underlying patterns governing electricity price fluctuations. This fundamental exploration enabled me to make nuanced predictions, accounting for the inherent cyclic patterns.

4. Precision and Validation:
Rigorous model evaluation and validation formed an integral phase of my journey. I meticulously fine-tuned model parameters, ensuring that the predictions were not merely proficient but exemplary in their accuracy. Empirical validation techniques substantiated the model's proficiency in capturing real-world electricity price dynamics.

5. Enabling Informed Decision-Making:
By transforming historical electricity price data into actionable insights, my project contributes substantially to informed decision-making within the energy sector. Stakeholders are equipped with a valuable tool that aids them in anticipating price fluctuations, optimizing energy procurement strategies, and orchestrating resource allocation more effectively.

In essence, my Electricity Price Prediction project leverages the prowess of the Seasonal ARIMA model to illuminate the path ahead for electricity prices. The fusion of rigorous methodology, predictive analytics, and seasonality comprehension positions this project at the forefront of data-driven decision-making within the energy landscape.
